# Firefox Dynamic Theme
### Day Night Dynamic Theme

A theme that changes throughout the day and night.

This theme will change the background image, hover and text colors throughout the day and night to closely match the time of day.

It is installed as an Add-on and not as a Theme per se.

Inspired by Mojave Dynamic Desktop.
